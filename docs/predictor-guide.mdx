## Before You Begin

Before creating a fund, consider the following:

### Strategy
Define your trading strategy clearly. Investors will evaluate your fund based on your approach—whether you focus on specific categories (crypto, economics, sports) or use a diversified approach.

### Lifecycle
Understand the fund lifecycle:
- **Open Stage**: Accept deposits, no trading allowed
- **Trading Stage**: Execute trades, deposits/withdrawals locked
- **Closed Stage**: Positions settled, investors can redeem

### Fees
You'll set two fee parameters at creation:
- **Deposit Fee** (0-3%): Charged immediately on each deposit
- **Performance Fee** (0-30%): Charged only on profits at fund closure

### Timeline
Choose your trading window carefully:
- **Trading Start Time**: When the Open stage ends and Trading begins
- **Trading End Time**: When trading stops and Settlement begins

> **⚠️ Important**: Fund parameters cannot be changed after creation.

### What Happens On-Chain

When you create a fund:

- A share token mint is created (controlled by the fund PDA)
- A vault USDC ATA is created (controlled by the fund PDA)
- Your wallet is registered as the fund manager

---

## Promoting Your Fund

After creation, promote your fund to attract investors:

### Share Your Fund Link
```
https://likeli.fund/vaults/{your-fund-address}
```

### Communicate Your Strategy
Be transparent about:
- Your trading approach
- Target markets (categories)
- Risk management
- Expected timeline
- Historical performance (if applicable)

### Set Expectations
- Be clear about potential risks
- Never promise guaranteed returns
- Explain the fee structure upfront

---

## Fee Collection

### Deposit Fees
- Transferred **immediately** to your fee wallet when investors deposit
- You receive: `deposit_amount * deposit_fee_bps / 10_000`
- Example: 2% fee on 1000 USDC = 20 USDC to you, 980 USDC to vault

### Performance Fees
- Calculated only when the fund is finalized
- Based on **profit only** (final balance - initial AUM)
- Automatically paid on the first investor redemption
- Formula: `max(0, final_balance - initial_aum) * perf_fee_bps / 10_000`
