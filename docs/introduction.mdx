## Key Selling Points

### Fully Permissionless
Anyone can start or invest in a prediction fund. No gatekeepers, no approval process—just connect your Solana wallet and get started.

### Profit Sharing
Expert predictors can specify a performance fee for their management. Earn a share of profits when your strategy succeeds.

### Fund Isolation
Managers are **only allowed to trade** in prediction markets with deposited funds. They cannot withdraw investor capital directly—only investors can redeem their shares.

### Built on DFlow
Likeli Funds leverages DFlow's tokenized prediction market infrastructure:
- **Market Discovery**: Access Kalshi markets tokenized on Solana
- **Best Execution**: DFlow routes orders for optimal pricing
- **On-chain Settlement**: All positions held as SPL tokens
