## Important Disclaimers

> **⚠️ Risk Warning**

Before depositing, understand:

1. **Manager Risk**: While managers cannot withdraw your funds directly, they can lose money through poor trading decisions.

2. **Smart Contract Risk**: Funds are held in on-chain program accounts. While audited, no smart contract is 100% risk-free.

3. **Market Risk**: Prediction markets can be volatile. Positions may lose value rapidly.

4. **Lockup Risk**: During the Trading stage, you **cannot** withdraw. Your funds are locked.

5. **No Guarantees**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Do your own research before investing.**

## FAQ

**Q: Can the manager steal my funds?**
A: No. The program enforces that managers can only trade on DFlow markets. They cannot transfer USDC to themselves.

**Q: What if the manager loses everything?**
A: You would receive little or no USDC at redemption. This is trading risk.

**Q: Can I withdraw early?**
A: Only during Open stage. During Trading, funds are locked.

**Q: What happens if markets don't resolve?**
A: The manager must wait or exit at market price before finalizing.
