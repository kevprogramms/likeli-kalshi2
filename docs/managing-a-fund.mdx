# Managing a Fund

Once your fund is created, you're responsible for managing it effectively throughout its lifecycle.

## Manager Dashboard

Access your dashboard at `/manage/{fund-address}` to view:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AUM** | Total assets under management (USDC + positions) |
| **Performance** | Current return vs initial AUM |
| **Open Positions** | Active prediction market positions |
| **Trade History** | Log of all executed trades |
| **Time Remaining** | Countdown to trading end |
| **Stage** | Current lifecycle stage |

---

## Manager Responsibilities

### Strategic Execution
- Deploy capital according to your stated strategy
- Monitor market conditions continuously
- Adjust positions as new information emerges

### Position Management
- Track all open positions
- Plan exit strategies before trading ends
- Ensure all positions are closed before finalization

### Risk Control
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Set mental stop-losses
- Diversify across markets when appropriate

### Communication
- Keep investors informed of major decisions
- Be transparent about strategy changes
- Explain significant wins or losses

## Risk Management Guidelines

### Position Sizing

| Rule | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Single Position** | Max 15-20% of AUM per market |
| **Correlated Markets** | Combined exposure ≤ 30% |
| **New Markets** | Start small, scale with conviction |

### Correlation Awareness
Markets can be correlated. Example:
- "Fed cuts rates in December" (80% YES)
- "Markets rally in Q1 2025" (65% YES)

If both resolve together, your portfolio risk may be higher than individual positions suggest.

### Gradual Deployment
Don't deploy all capital immediately:
- Week 1: 30-40% deployment
- Week 2-3: Scale to 60-70%
- Final weeks: Reduce to allow for exits

### Exit Criteria
Plan your exits:
- Target profit levels
- Maximum loss thresholds
- Time-based exits (before trading ends)

> **⚠️ Critical**: You must close all positions before `finalize_close` can be called. The vault must hold only USDC.

## Communication with Depositors

### Best Practices

1. **Weekly Updates** (recommended)
   - Current performance
   - Position summary (high-level)
   - Market outlook

2. **Significant Events**
   - Large trades (>10% of AUM)
   - Major wins or losses
   - Strategy adjustments

3. **Transparency Levels**
   Choose what to disclose:
   - Full transparency: All positions visible
   - Delayed: Positions shown after 60 minutes
   - Aggregate only: Just category exposure
